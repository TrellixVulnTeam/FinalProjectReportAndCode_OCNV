A percent-encoded
octet is encoded
as a character triplet
consisting of the
percent character
followed by the two
representing that
octet's numeric value.
character serves as the indicator
"%25" for that octet to be used
as data within a URI." I read
only appear if it is followed
by two hex digits.
How do you read it?
